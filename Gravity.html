    From a nightmare I woke up<br>
    And my strength was gone<br>
    Lost in his grip<br>
    Thought I was the one<br>
    Lost my way<br>
    And my will<br>
    And astray I could feel<br>
    The shame<br>
    <br>
    He was bright<br>
    He was fine<br>
    And he lit me oh light<br>
    But it burned<br>
    And I yearned<br>
    For the cool of the night<br>
    <br>
    Taking chances I wept<br>
    But my tears were kept<br>
    Inside<br>
    And I burned so tough<br>
    Revolving him hurt<br>
    And I never met my dark side<br>
    <br>
    So I turned away<br>
    Wandered the lines<br>
    In the darkness afraid<br>
    He had blinded my eyes<br>
    But I could finally cry<br>
    <br>
    And the fog went away<br>
    I could see what I craved<br>
    And I looked at the far<br>
    Furthest than where you are<br>
    Out the sun I could see<br>
    the stars<br>
