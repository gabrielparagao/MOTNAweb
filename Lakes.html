    In secrecy sworn to the highs<br>
    Blessed by the Gods<br>
    From Myth or Christ<br>
    Where all the droplets are fruit-full<br>
    And all the tenants are kind<br>
    Abundance is scrutinized<br>
    For none ever wilt<br>
    Water goddess in holy state<br>
    Where there are lakes in the sky<br>
    <br>
    The most wondrous<br>
    Glistening view<br>
    Iris arc in all croma tones<br>
    In cotton flowers of prism petals<br>
    Of beauty never understood<br>
    By lower race<br>
    <br>
    Being capable of love means sole duty<br>
    While for some it seems hard to comply<br>
    No human shall ever thread<br>
    For no hateful being is light<br>
    <br>
    And beauty so delicate one fall through<br>
    And truth so devoted none dare doubt<br>
    All of it’s instance is blue<br>
    And all of its peace is cloud<br>
    <br>
    No need for desire<br>
    In eden bliss<br>
    No stomach growls<br>
    <br>
    Thou beauty is in the seer<br>
    It’s people never seen dark<br>
    But everywhere it goes it follows<br>
    And casts a shadow<br>
    In the land bellow<br>
    <br>
    Theres no love with no hate<br>
    No past without fate<br>
    No force can break thy rules<br>
    For the universe is bigger than a God<br>
    It is the truth<br>
    <br>
    And each instance of each bless<br>
    And each spawn from that womb<br>
    Is unique in every property<br>
    And one cell creates it’s own world<br>
    Across stars and no matter<br>
    There is no source better<br>
    For life given and liven<br>
    And its fluid form thriving<br>
    <br>
    Its in all it’s beings<br>
    And in all its being<br>
    The all needed regeneration<br>
    Make powerful<br>
    The unhidden, unbidden treasure<br>
    No map can truly show<br>
    Take your share but sin is thunderous<br>
    For balance broken<br>
    It all melts away<br>
    In saddening destruction<br>
    Here comes rain<br>
