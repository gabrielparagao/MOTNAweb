    Her birth was the most impactful and dramatic in the history of the
    universe, for it was the first, the boom, the big bang. She felt every atom
    on her own expand. She knew it was time, it had started, her time had come,
    all before had lived through and now her time prevailed. No surprise was to
    come for she had lived everything, in the concept of time the is the concept
    itself. The Amber watch struck for the first time in her hand. And when the
    first explosion was done, when the first boundaries of the universe had set,
    she was right there in the middle of it all, the very embodiment of that
    universe’s energy, the most pure form, the frequency every atom vibrates to.
    The keeper of time for that universe’s incarnation. The one timeline that
    was hers and hers only. So she sat for a bit, in the cold core, watching all
    of her dissipate as she sees the past, present and future. Wondering what
    she would do first. She may know everything there is to come, she may know
    everything that was before, but the future is never set in stone, the
    present is the most important decision. So she floated in space, for a long
    time, feeling her own expand at incredible rate compared to her size now,
    yet she knew that compared to all her power, that was day 1 of eons to come.
    From the burst, the first stars were settled and the first solar systems
    were created, many she didn’t even care to remember for they were her
    unconscious bursts of life, chaos liberated and to balance she would have to
    learn the present. She wandered and wondered for she never knew the meaning
    of the universe until she found herself being it. She knew how it worked,
    every piece of it, but she didn’t know why, I guess the whole point is
    figuring out, and once she did it would make itself over again. The void of
    space wasn’t boring because she could see, hear, feel and control every
    spectrum for it was all her. But after wondering for so long, long enough to
    have forgotten when she was born, nothing filled her being, nothing made her
    complete. She still hadn’t found the meaning of anything, she was just
    matter floating and expanding. Until she heard an echo. From nowhere she
    heard a thought, it was loneliness. She had no clue what could fulfill so,
    after long wondering she felt she found the right place. It felt like home
    to her, like a magical map pointing to where maybe in the grand scale her
    heart would be. It was time, time to meddle, make the present hers. Time to
    make the universe have more meaning, time to make time be felt. She needed
    friends, so from herself she created them, and in that she received one of
    her first names “Gaia”. Born from the fire of her passion, the God of
    Energy, what would set her self on fire and her story's start, her meaning,
    he is the origin story of her creation. He shone to her and took her breath
    away, and that moment sparked his fire, that devoted breath full of meaning
    and magick brought his life and he grew widely, and she was truly impressed
    with her first creation, and in interstellar communion, in blessed
    engagement, she created the Sun. She spent the best days feeling his warmth,
    finally she felt accomplished, safe, as if she could just give in. From
    those days she had the most funny ideas. What about a planet with rings
    around it? So she made Saturn to entertain him. What about a planet so
    romantic you can feel it’s pull? So she made Venus, and even though she felt
    like it wasn’t complete, she gave it to him. And from that all solar planets
    were created. Except one. One of them was different, after giving so many
    presents to this system, she felt something amiss. Missing, something to
    give meaning to that place, in the expansion of the universe she never felt
    something so intense. Not even the fire of the sun could burn her so, the
    way solitude could. No matter how much heat the sun gave her, how much he
    would burn for her, how he would die for her, none of that mattered because
    she made him that way. Chaos needed more from her, she had so much inside
    but at the rate of expansion she would be stretched thin soon. So she cried,
    howled at the void, the sun felt sorry, the planets worried. If she were to
    ever break, they would go with her. But something else happened. Her cries
    made a planet with an element so different, none had seen its swiftness
    before. That one she took to herself, She felt like it was time she gave a
    piece of her self to a creation. She took her time, 7 days, a billion years,
    she burned every gas, created every mass, picked every element, terraformed
    the mountains and carved the seas and in the end drenched it in water. And
    throughout this whole thing it was a self discovery journey, she felt water
    had something important about it.
