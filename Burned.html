    Still it felt cold<br>
    Empty<br>
    She needed that love<br>
    Addictive<br>
    Embrace of<br>
    More than heat<br>
    Her chest felt empty<br>
    As if she realized her lungs<br>
    Her ribs meaningless<br>
    Her heart, gone<br>
    <br>
    Insides all jumbled<br>
    And butterflies all around<br>
    But from dread and bourbon<br>
    And it all started burning down<br>
    <br>
    And it felt like an ocean<br>
    Churned so hard drowned itself<br>
    And the birds sang in her head<br>
    The universe thought herself dead<br>
    <br>
    And when there was no more chance<br>
    She took her souls intent<br>
    From the need for love<br>
    They came<br>
    Planet born<br>
    In mother’s praise<br>
    <br>
    And life born throughout<br>
    She cried for help<br>
    And got a crowd<br>
    <br>
    The bluest one so far<br>
    Like none in any star<br>
    Embraced the earth<br>
    Gracious water’s birth<br>
    <br>
    The planet she gave her soul<br>
    To make life avert control<br>
    She created consciousness<br>
    And blessed thy with<br>
    The true meaning<br>
    Of water’s gift<br>
    What burned inside was ice<br>
