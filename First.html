And every breath she took<br>
Make life<br>
And all the stars created light<br>
And brightly burn scorched<br>
Icarus wings<br>
And he grew widely<br>
Her first love made her heart march<br>
None before had burned so<br>
Intense passion and caring love<br>
In fervorous fashion<br>
His fire burned low<br>
For his love was not about bursting<br>
But about control<br>
And in careful<br>
Fingers trail lighting<br>
Making love<br>
Threading lightly<br>
For each touch burned true<br>
And all desire turned fuel<br>
And in holy sacrifice<br>
Human ritual or not<br>
In crazy euphoria<br>
In her love she made a God<br>
No cloud could block his bliss<br>
All shadows were cast by it<br>
All beings bathed and needed<br>
Its warmth, its touch<br>
It’s breath<br>
And you can follow<br> 
But reach in no amount of steps<br>
No one can touch<br>
Or her path ever thread<br>
She was the one he ever loved<br>
And much loved back<br>
Who call Amún<br>
Apollo<br>
Sól<br>
Worshiped and loved by all<br>
But she’d rather not name him<br>
Love let freed of owning<br>
And it was beautiful, but<br>
Even if he burst in gold<br>
In super nova explosion<br>
Even if he created a black hole<br>
She would shine stronger<br>
Even if he burned to the last of his tank<br>
She could’ve burned longer<br>
And though he tried to make her stay<br>
She burned blue<br>
For she created the sun<br>
In the first dawn of her moon<br>
